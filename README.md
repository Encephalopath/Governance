2º Members join the community to contribute to the Loopring Foundation by improving any aspects necessary in the project, according to their own capacities.

3º Each member is free to contribute to any other project or initiative.

4º As an initial governance model, any member can contribute to Loopring project and receive 100% of the reward.

5º Members compromise themselves to contribute to the Loopring project through the Fellowship of the Ring Github.

   6.3 - the members will decide by democratic means the percentage of this cut;

   6.4 - each yearly quarter, the members will elect the council, initially composed by 3 members;

   6.5 - the members will vote on changes to this Constitution each quarter if needed, requiring at least 2/3 of members’ votes for each of the change’s approval.
